# Rails Best Practices

- [Smalltalk-Style MVC with smart Views pulling data instead of dumb Views with Controllers pushing data](https://andymaleh.blogspot.com/2011/10/decoupling-views-from-controllers-in.html)
- [Rails Helper Presenters of Model information](https://andymaleh.blogspot.com/2011/10/decoupling-views-from-controllers-in.html)
- Rails Partial View components that accept either instance variables or local parameters
- Modals are displayed instantly without making web requests (to avoid hindering user experience) by including as partials in web pages that need them
- Using [State Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern), which keeps the code close to the business domain, instead of State Machine (which is a low level computer science concept that distances the code from the business domain, thus not recommended except in the theoretical computing field)
