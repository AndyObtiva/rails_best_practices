- [Smalltalk-Style MVC with smart Views pulling data instead of dumb Views with Controllers pushing data](https://andymaleh.blogspot.com/2011/10/decoupling-views-from-controllers-in.html)
- [Rails Helper Presenters of Model information](https://andymaleh.blogspot.com/2011/10/decoupling-views-from-controllers-in.html)
- Rails Partial View components that accept either instance variables or local parameters
- Modals are displayed instantly without making web requests (to avoid hindering user experience) by including as partials in web pages that need them
